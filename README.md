RPSLS To increase the odds of the old fashioned game (Rock, Paper, Scissors) Sheldon and Raj increase the odds to have 5 different items instead of 3. Hence forth Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

To test the result of the game write a Kata!

Examples:
 - rpsls("rock", "spock") #should return "Player 2 won!"
 - rpsls("scissor", "lizard") #should return "Player 1 won!"
 - rpsls("scissor", "Scissor") #should return "Draw!"
 - rpsls("foo", "Bar") #should return "Oh, Unknown Thing"
